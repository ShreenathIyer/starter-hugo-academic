Hi there,

My name is Shreenath, and I am a Software Engineer 2 at Amazon. Glad you're here. 

I joined Amazon in 2019, where I initially started working on Native AWS applications built in Java. Between 2019 and 2021, I worked on Coral based services built in AWS Lambda using Java and React for the Advertising Org within Amazon. In that duration, I improved the operations of the team by automating deployment processes and replacing manual work for our users with self service tools. I also enabled our recommendation systems to cover a broader array of targeting attributes, all of which resulted in positive user feedback.

I was promoted to an SDE 2 in April 2021. In 2021, I set up the foundation for an automated data ingestion pipeline that still ingests Terabytes of data daily to Elasticsearch, which is then consumed by applications hosted on our web interface. This was also shipped as a reusable construct for different teams in our organization. In addition to that, I have led and executed the inclusion of additional advertising entities on our platform.

Lately, I have been working closely with Science teams in our org to help them develop and deploy ML models in an automated way to improve our user experience.

Prior to 2019, I completed my Master's in Computer Science from the University of California, Davis. I completed by Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2015 from the University of Pune, India. 

I have also worked as a Product Development Engineer at FIS Global between June 2015 and July 2017. I was intern at Nokia Nuage Networks between June 2018 - Aug 2018. 

I am also a part of the winning team of the Amazon Alexa Prize 2018.

When I am not working, I like to read about history, politics and Software design, in no particular order. 

I also love watching and playing soccer, and I have been at it for about 15 years now.
